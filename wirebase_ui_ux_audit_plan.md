# UI/UX Audit Plan for wirebase.city

## Overview

The wirebase.city project has a cyberpunk/hacker aesthetic with a dark theme. This audit will identify all pages with inconsistent or incomplete styling/functionality compared to the main pages, focusing on:

1. Visual consistency with the main site's cyberpunk aesthetic
2. Functional completeness
3. Responsive design issues
4. Accessibility concerns
5. Performance issues

We already know the user registration/identity creation page has both styling inconsistencies and functional issues.

### Step 1: Identify All User-Facing Pages

Based on the project structure analysis, we'll categorize all user-facing pages:

1. **Core Pages**
   - Home page (`/`)
   - About page (`/about`)
   - Discover feed (`/discover`)
   - FAQ, Privacy, Terms pages

2. **User Authentication**
   - Login page (`/users/login`)
   - Registration page (`/users/register`)
   - Password reset page (`/users/forgot-password`)
   - Account settings (`/users/settings`)

3. **Profile Pages**
   - User profile (`/profile`)
   - Profile viewing (`/profile/:username`)
   - Profile HTML/CSS editing (`/profile/edit/html`, `/profile/edit/css`)
   - Terminal mode (`/profile/terminal`)

4. **Feed Pages**
   - Main feed (`/feed`)
   - Feed subscription (`/feed/subscribe`)
   - User-specific feeds (`/feed/user/:username`)
   - Category-specific feeds (`/feed/scrapyard/:category`)

5. **Forum Pages**
   - Forum home (`/forum`)
   - Category view (`/forum/category/:category`)
   - Thread view (`/forum/thread/:id`)
   - New thread creation (`/forum/new`)

6. **Market Pages**
   - Market home (`/market`)
   - Browse items (`/market/browse`)
   - Item view (`/market/item/:id`)
   - Collections (`/market/collections`, `/market/collections/:id`)
   - Item submission (`/market/submit`)
   - User wishlist (`/market/user/wishlist`)
   - WIR dashboard (`/market/wir`)

7. **Scrapyard Pages**

   - Category view (`/scrapyard/category/:category`)
   - Item view (`/scrapyard/item/:id`)
   - Item submission (`/scrapyard/submit`)
   - Search results (`/scrapyard/search`)

### Step 2: Establish Baseline Standards

We'll define baseline standards by examining the main site's high-quality pages:

1. **Visual Standards**
   - Color palette (from cyber-variables.css)
   - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights)
   - UI components (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
   - Special effects (glitch animations, scanlines, etc.)
   - Layout patterns

2. **Functional Standards**
   - Expected interactive elements
   - Form validation
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - User feedback mechanisms

3. **Responsive Design Standards**
   - Breakpoints
   - Mobile adaptations
   - Touch-friendly interfaces

4. **Accessibility Standards**
   - Color contrast
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Focus states

5. **Performance Standards**
   - Load times
   - Animation smoothness
   - Resource usage

### Step 3: Audit Each Page

For each page, we'll conduct a thorough audit using the following process:

1. **Visual Consistency Check**
   - Compare with baseline visual standards
   - Check for missing or inconsistent styling
   - Verify proper implementation of cyberpunk aesthetic
   - Check for proper use of CSS variables

2. **Functionality Check**
   - Test all interactive elements
   - Verify form submissions and validation
   - Check error handling
   - Test user flows

3. **Responsive Design Check**
   - Test at multiple viewport sizes
   - Verify proper layout adaptation
   - Check for overflow issues
   - Test touch interactions

4. **Accessibility Check**
   - Verify proper semantic HTML
   - Check ARIA attributes
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify color contrast

5. **Performance Check**
   - Measure load times
   - Check for unnecessary resource loading
   - Identify performance bottlenecks

### Step 4: Document Issues

For each page with issues, we'll document:

1. Page URL/name
2. Issue category (visual, functional, responsive, accessibility, performance)
3. Issue description
4. Severity (critical, high, medium, low)
5. Recommended fix
6. Reference to baseline standard

## Enhanced Issue Prioritization Framework

The prioritization of identified issues will be a critical component of this audit. We'll use a multi-dimensional scoring system to ensure that the most important issues are addressed first.

### Primary Prioritization Criteria

1. **User Impact Score (1-10)**
   - **High (8-10)**: Issues affecting core user journeys (registration, login, content creation)
   - **Medium (4-7)**: Issues affecting secondary features (profile customization, feed viewing)
   - **Low (1-3)**: Issues affecting tertiary features (settings, help pages)

2. **Visibility Score (1-10)**
   - **High (8-10)**: Issues on landing pages, main navigation, or frequently visited pages
   - **Medium (4-7)**: Issues on secondary pages that users visit occasionally
   - **Low (1-3)**: Issues on rarely visited pages or admin sections

3. **Brand Consistency Score (1-10)**
   - **High (8-10)**: Severe deviations from the cyberpunk aesthetic that break immersion
   - **Medium (4-7)**: Noticeable inconsistencies that don't match the main site's quality
   - **Low (1-3)**: Minor styling differences that don't significantly impact user experience

4. **Functional Severity Score (1-10)**
   - **Critical (9-10)**: Prevents core functionality from working (broken forms, navigation)
   - **High (7-8)**: Significantly impairs functionality but has workarounds
   - **Medium (4-6)**: Causes user friction but doesn't prevent task completion
   - **Low (1-3)**: Minor annoyances or edge cases

5. **Implementation Complexity Score (1-10)**
   - **Simple (1-3)**: Quick CSS fixes or minor HTML adjustments
   - **Moderate (4-7)**: Requires template modifications or JavaScript changes
   - **Complex (8-10)**: Requires architectural changes or backend modifications

### Prioritization Matrix

We'll use a weighted scoring system to calculate a final priority score:

```
Priority Score = (User Impact × 0.3) + (Visibility × 0.25) + (Brand Consistency × 0.2) + (Functional Severity × 0.15) + (10 - Implementation Complexity) × 0.1
```

This formula gives more weight to user impact and visibility while also considering the ease of implementation (inverse of complexity).

### Priority Tiers

Based on the calculated priority scores, issues will be categorized into tiers:

1. **Critical Priority (8.0-10.0)**
   - Must be addressed immediately
   - Severely impacts user experience or brand perception
   - Typically affects high-traffic pages or core user flows

2. **High Priority (6.0-7.9)**
   - Should be addressed in the next development cycle
   - Significantly impacts user experience or brand consistency
   - Affects important user journeys or prominent pages

3. **Medium Priority (4.0-5.9)**
   - Should be scheduled for upcoming work
   - Moderately impacts user experience
   - Affects secondary features or pages

4. **Low Priority (1.0-3.9)**
   - Can be addressed when resources allow
   - Minimal impact on user experience
   - Affects tertiary features or rarely visited pages

### Quick Wins Identification

We'll also flag "quick wins" - issues that have:
- High visibility or user impact
- Low implementation complexity
- Can be fixed independently of other issues

These quick wins will be highlighted in the report as opportunities for immediate improvement with minimal resource investment.

### Dependency Mapping

Some issues may be interconnected or dependent on other fixes. We'll create a dependency map to ensure that:

1. Foundational issues are addressed before dependent ones
2. Related issues can be fixed together for efficiency
3. Critical path dependencies are clearly identified
